Okay, my first post. Where to begin.. I started my development bootcamp on April 3th at Codaisseur in Amsterdam and I like it! I learned so much and I continue to learn something new every day. My first week I leared to work with Ruby. The second week that became Ruby on Rails. I found it amazing how intuitive this language is. It's almost like writhing normal sentences.  
After three weeks of Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I started learning JavaScript. So many more possibilities now! I learned how to use Javascript with ReactJS and how to combine this with Ruby on Rails.
